                    <p class="topic-text">
                        Your client/customer simply cannot trust your business in today's dy and age
                        without a high-quality web presence. By having a professional website designed,
                        you can show that you care about your brand and business reputation.
                        Adding more functionality to the site will make your brand stand out from the
                        competition.

                        So social media may suffice for new small businesses, but if you want to have a big
                        and reputable buisness you should consider having a corporate website or online store
                        designed to professionally represent your buisness online. It is about how the online 
                        face of the business looks to customers living in the digital era.
                        A business without a website cannot project a compelling and trustworthy image.
                        A reliable brand cannot be built with only social networks or with some cooky-cutting 
                        website. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Answer your client's questions more thoroughly</h4>
                    <p class="topic-text">  
                        A  website can be a platform to answer all basic questions your potential customers
                        may have about your business and brand. When people visit your website, they seek 
                        answers to basic questions like what you do, your products/solutions, your location,
                        contact details, etc. Once they are satisfied with all that, they decide to either 
                        follow up or not.
